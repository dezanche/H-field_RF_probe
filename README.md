These are typically connected to a network analyzer to measure frequency response of RF "coils" used in MRI and NMR.
Another use is EMI sniffer probe connected to a spectrum analyzer. 
Connection from the board to coaxial cable is made through a side-launch connector such as SMA.
The panelized version allows 4 identical probes to be printed on a 100mmx100mm panel.
